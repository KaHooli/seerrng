# Discovery integrations

SeerrNG can connect personal Trakt, AniList and Simkl accounts. Administrator
application credentials and personal account credentials are separate. Connecting
a tracker does not enable signing in to SeerrNG with that tracker.

## Application setup

Open **Settings → Discovery Integrations** as an administrator. Configure the
application Client ID and secret for Trakt or AniList, the application Client ID
for Simkl, and an API key for MDBList. The MDBList key also enables optional
aggregated ratings on movie and series details, poster rating popovers, and
collection averages. SeerrNG uses MDBList values where direct Rotten Tomatoes or
IMDb ratings are missing and adds Metacritic and Trakt scores; an MDBList outage
does not hide ratings from other sources. AniList uses its PIN authorization redirect:
`https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin`.

Secrets are hidden after saving. Editing only one field retains the other saved
values. **Clear this integration** prepares removal of its credentials; save the
settings to apply it. Changing a provider's Client ID invalidates connections
created for the previous application.

## Connect a personal account

Open **Profile → Settings → Linked Accounts → Discovery Accounts**. Choose
**Connect**, follow the provider authorization page, and approve the connection.
Trakt and Simkl display an authorization code and wait for confirmation. AniList
provides a code to paste into SeerrNG. You can cancel or disconnect a connection.

## Browse

Use **Explore provider recommendations and lists** on Discover. Trakt offers
personal recommendations, watchlists and history. AniList offers anime catalogs
and your linked anime library. MDBList accepts public list URLs or list IDs.

When you connect a personal account, Discover also shows a **Picked for You**
section with that account's available rows: Trakt movie and series
recommendations and watchlist, plus AniList and Simkl planning and in-progress
lists. Rows with no titles are hidden. These rows use the signed-in user's
connection and keep provider titles visible when SeerrNG cannot confirm a TMDB
match.

Titles with confirmed TMDB IDs use the normal movie/series cards. Titles without
a confirmed match retain their original provider identity and are marked
**Catalog match pending**. Search the SeerrNG catalog and confirm a movie or
series to attach a private match to a stable Trakt, AniList, or MDBList ID.
When a source also supplies an IMDb or TVDB ID, SeerrNG can resolve that exact
ID through TMDB and use the result only when it is unique, has the expected
movie or series type, and still exists in the catalog. Ambiguous or unavailable
results remain available for manual repair. An exact-ID result is shown as
automatic; choose **Change title match** to save a private override. The
**Show unmatched titles** filter keeps the remaining repair queue visible on the
current feed page. Private matches are also used in My Library when the same
provider item appears there. Provider IDs are preserved; SeerrNG does not infer
a match from title text.
Provider errors identify whether an account needs reconnecting, MDBList setup is
missing, an MDBList list is unavailable, or the provider is temporarily down.
When a provider reports a quota cooldown, Retry stays disabled until that window
ends.

## Personal library and tracking

Open **My Library** to browse your connected Trakt, AniList, or Simkl account,
or the movie and series libraries visible to your linked Plex, Jellyfin, or
Emby account. Media-server libraries are read-only in SeerrNG and use your own
provider account, so libraries hidden from that account are not shown. Choose a
server library and browse its all, watched, unwatched, or in-progress shelf.
Only media-server libraries enabled in SeerrNG and visible to your linked
account appear. Watched and unwatched filters use that account's playback state;
in-progress includes partially played movies and series. Sparse in-progress
results are filled from bounded provider batches. A status notice appears when a
page reaches its scan limit; **Next** continues from the returned cursor while
more results are available, up to SeerrNG's safety cap. Link the media-server
account under **Profile → Settings**; tracking-account connections remain under
**Linked Accounts**.

Trakt shelves can show movies and series together or filter either type; the
provider still pages each type separately. AniList and Simkl show the linked
user's native library and keep provider IDs when a confirmed TMDB match is
unavailable. Use **Match catalog title** to choose a confirmed movie or series
for an unmatched item; the saved match is private to your user and can be
changed or reset later. Simkl anime entries stay unmapped until the identity and
media type can be confirmed.

Choose **Find exact ID matches across this library** to scan a connected
Trakt, AniList, or Simkl shelf for unique IMDb or TVDB matches. SeerrNG scans
five pages at a time, saves confirmed matches to your private title matches,
and lets you stop and resume the scan. Existing private and administrator
shared matches are preserved. Titles without a unique exact match remain
available for manual matching; SeerrNG does not match them by title text.

Provider writes are off by default. To enable them, turn on the explicit
watched-status, progress, and rating consent for each account under **Linked
Accounts**. SeerrNG only sends a change after you choose an action on a title.
AniList ratings retain its tenth-point scale and anime episode progress is
bounded by the provider's current episode count. Trakt and Simkl ratings use
whole-number 1–10 values; choose **Remove rating** to clear one. Changing a
series watched state applies to the whole series, and SeerrNG asks you to
confirm. Removing a movie's watched state also asks for confirmation.
For Trakt and Simkl TV titles, open **Episode-level tracking**, choose a season
and episode, then mark that episode watched. The episode choices show each
episode's current watched state from Trakt or Simkl, and the action switches to
the matching watched or unwatched change. Removing one episode's watched status
asks for confirmation. SeerrNG sends the selected catalog coordinates and uses
the linked TMDB and TVDB series IDs when available; Simkl's anime season mapping
is enabled only for anime when its configured metadata provider supplies TVDB
coordinates. The episode list follows the configured TV metadata provider, so
use the same season order that your provider account recognizes.

When a provider does not confirm a write, SeerrNG records the outcome as
uncertain and will not automatically repeat that action. Check the provider
account before choosing the same change again.

## Back up title matches

The **Personal title matches** section at the top of **My Library** exports a
versioned JSON pack of your saved provider-to-catalog matches. Choose that file
to restore it on another SeerrNG install; the import preview reports how many
matches it contains before you apply it. Existing matches for the same provider
item are updated, and matches for other users are never changed. Packs contain
provider item IDs and TMDB IDs only, not account tokens or application secrets.
An import can be restored before you reconnect the provider accounts; the
matches take effect when those items appear in a library or discovery feed.

## Administrator-managed shared matches

Administrators can publish versioned packs under **Settings → Discovery
Integrations → Shared discovery title matches**. A published pack applies to
every account on this SeerrNG instance. The page previews each pack before it is
published, asks for an explicit instance-wide confirmation, and requires a
second confirmation before deleting a pack. Packs can be downloaded for backup
or transfer to another instance.

Publishing a pack replaces all entries for the same pack ID. Each provider
identity can appear in only one shared pack; an import with an identity already
owned by another pack is rejected. Packs are limited to 10,000 entries and
contain provider item IDs and TMDB matches, never provider credentials.

Shared matches are applied in discovery feeds and connected libraries when an
item does not already have a catalog ID. A match you save privately takes
precedence over a shared pack. You can change a shared match on an item to save
a private override; removing or replacing the shared pack does not remove that
private match.

## Release calendar

**Calendar** displays movie releases, series episodes, album releases, book
releases, comic issues, magazine issues, and requested PC games or emulation
titles. Movies, series, music, and books come from configured Radarr, Sonarr,
Lidarr, and Readarr-compatible Bookshelf services. Comic issues use dates from
Mylar3 or Kapowarr. BackIssue does not currently provide release-calendar
issue entries; magazine issues use dates from LazyLibrarian. Issues without an
exact day are omitted. Software release dates use the configured QuestarrNG
or ROMarrNG catalog's exact IGDB date for the requested PC operating system or
emulation platform. If a provider does not return platform-specific dates,
SeerrNG omits those game entries and marks the source partial; update that
provider to a build with platform-release-date support. **My requests** is the
default scope and follows the request's standard, 4K, ebook, audiobook, PC
operating-system/architecture, or emulation-system target. Music entries match
by MusicBrainz release-group ID; book entries match provider identities rather
than titles. Users with request-view or management permissions can select the
shared calendar. Only administrators can include unmonitored titles.

Movie, album, book, comic issue, magazine issue, and game dates are displayed as
calendar dates. Episode air times use your browser's time zone. Album entries
link to their music details page and show the artist name when Lidarr provides
it. Book entries link to the matching Bookshelf details page, show the author,
and retain the configured ebook or audiobook format. Comic and magazine issue
entries link to their title details page; game entries link to the matching
software catalog title. If a service is unavailable, the calendar identifies
the missing source and keeps results from successful services. Results and
backend reads are bounded and briefly cached; narrow the month or media type
when the result limit is reached.

SeerrNG checks monitored Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Readarr-compatible Bookshelf,
Mylar3, Kapowarr, and LazyLibrarian releases daily and records date changes
after the first snapshot. Calendar entries can show the three most recent
changes from the last 180 days, including the old and new dates or air times.
The history uses the same **My requests** or shared-calendar visibility as the
release itself. Administrators can run or disable **Release Calendar History**
under **Settings → Jobs & Cache**. Software catalog dates are not included in
these daily snapshots.
