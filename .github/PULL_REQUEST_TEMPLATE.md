## Release Notes

<!--
  Add one validated fragment under release-notes/ for every user-facing
  change. Select the internal-only option only when there is no user-visible
  behavior, documentation, security, or operational change.

  A release note must say what changed, who is affected, which product area it
  belongs to, and what action is required (or explicitly say `action: none`).
  See `release-notes/README.md` for the complete schema and preview command.

  Select exactly one of the first two options. The confirmation boxes below
  them may also be selected when they apply.
