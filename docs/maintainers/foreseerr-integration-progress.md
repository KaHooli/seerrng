# Foreseerr integration implementation

Approved scope covers discovery providers, calendar, queue intervention, personal
library and tracking, identity and episode mappings, watch-ahead, an optional
Jellyfin bridge to a separate SeerrNG server, and optional native playback.

## Implemented foundation

- Adapted MIT-licensed Trakt, AniList, Simkl and MDBList clients with attribution.
- Bounded provider caches, private cache isolation and Trakt read coalescing.
- Application credentials managed by administrators; secret values never returned.
- Personal account storage, server-owned device flows, AniList PIN exchange,
  account disconnect and explicit write-consent storage.
- Provider discovery pages for Trakt, AniList and MDBList; known TMDB IDs use
  existing lazy title-card hydration. Unmatched candidates are displayed as such.
- Discover now adds signed-in-user rows for Trakt recommendations and watchlists,
  AniList planning/in-progress shelves, and Simkl planning/in-progress shelves.
  Rows are limited to that user's connected providers and keep unmapped titles.
- Trakt, AniList, and MDBList discovery feeds let users confirm unmatched titles
  against TMDB, filter to the unmatched items on the current page, and change or
  reset private mappings without rewriting provider IDs.
- Exact IMDb and TVDB identifiers from Trakt, MDBList and supported personal
  libraries are resolved through TMDB when the result is unique and type-safe.
  Stale, ambiguous and unavailable matches stay in the manual repair flow; users
  can save a private override for an automatic result.
- Personal Trakt, AniList, and Simkl libraries support bounded bulk repair scans
  with progress, stop/resume, batches of up to five pages, and a 500-page cap.
  Only unique, type-safe matches from supported exact IMDb/TVDB identifiers are
  saved; titles without those identifiers remain available for manual repair.
- Users can export and import a versioned personal mapping pack without provider
  credentials. Import is bounded, transactional, idempotent, and private to the
  importing account; it can be restored before provider reconnection.
- Administrators can publish, export and remove bounded versioned title-match
  packs shared by every account on the instance. Provider identities are unique
  across shared packs, private matches take precedence, and the UI requires an
  explicit all-accounts acknowledgement before publishing and a second step
  before deleting.
- My Library browses Trakt, AniList, Simkl, Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby shelves;
  explicit watched, rating, and AniList progress writes are confirmed and
  idempotent. Trakt and Simkl also support explicit per-episode watched changes
  from the configured season list, with matched TMDB/TVDB IDs and Simkl's
  current anime-season mapping contract. Trakt and Simkl now show provider
  watched state beside each episode; Trakt's active rewatch reset is respected,
  and Simkl status reads are limited to the selected show and season. Manual
  TMDB matches are private to the current user's library.
- TV request owners can opt into Jellyfin watch-ahead when their linked Jellyfin
  user, TV-request permission, and matching Sonarr destination are available.
  The worker checks active playback every 30 seconds, requires Jellyfin to mark
  the matching episode played at or beyond 90% runtime, retains progress while
  approval is pending, and creates linked, quota-exempt Sonarr child requests
  under the parent approval to maintain a buffer of up to five missing episodes.
  Disabling watch-ahead stops future additions and leaves already-created child
  requests in place.
- Movie/series/music/book release calendar with personal/shared scopes, bounded
  cached backend reads, episode hydration and partial-source reporting across
  Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and Readarr-compatible Bookshelf services. The
  calendar also shows requested comic and magazine issues from Mylar3,
  Kapowarr, and LazyLibrarian when the issue has an exact date, plus requested
  PC games and emulation titles from their IGDB release dates. Issue and game
  lookups are bounded, run with three concurrent calls, and use short provider
  caches. The daily date-history job records comic and magazine date changes;
  it skips the optional game catalog lookups.
- Daily date-change snapshots for monitored Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and
  Readarr-compatible Bookshelf, Mylar3, Kapowarr, and LazyLibrarian releases.
  The calendar shows up to three recent moves per event; snapshots reset after
  long observation gaps to avoid presenting stale dates as fresh changes.
- Dedicated-permission download intervention inbox with durable warnings, explicit
  rejection options, existing-library matching and backend-specific manual-import
  previews for Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr and Readarr, backend identity checks,
  command/history outcome verification and bounded action history.
- Optional Jellyfin companion plugin for a separately deployed SeerrNG server.
  The plugin adds an administrator-dashboard shortcut, validates an already-linked user's
  current session on the SeerrNG server, and supports administrator and account
  unlink revocation without replacing other media-server integrations.
  It has now been installed and exercised against the official Jellyfin 10.11.11
  container: plugin loading, authenticated settings persistence, the bridge
  configuration endpoint, administrator shortcut, and settings page pass.
- Optional native desktop playback implements Foreseer Desktop protocol v1 for
  single-item Jellyfin handoff. Browser playback remains the fallback. Bootstrap
  tickets are short-lived, single-use, PKCE-bound, reject browser-originated
  redemption, and tied to the active browser session, credentials, Jellyfin user
  identity, and configured server authority. The native session is reset when a
  SeerrNG account logs out or changes.
- Selectable QuestarrNG or ROMarrNG IGDB catalog for emulation, with QuestarrNG
  retained for PC games and ROMarrNG for ROM acquisition. Provider actions and
  game/platform identity use the versioned SeerrNG integration contract.
- Matching OpenAPI paths, SQLite/PostgreSQL migrations and regression coverage.
- Provider discovery recovery distinguishes account reconnection, missing
  MDBList setup, unavailable public lists, quota cooldowns and temporary outages.

## Remaining work

- Verify personalized dashboard feeds, credentials, and quota recovery with
  live provider accounts.
- Verify manual-import payloads and acquisition actions against live services,
  including the supported Readarr-compatible backend variants.
- Additional provider-specific live resolvers beyond the exact IMDb/TVDB
  identifiers currently supported. AniList library entries do not expose either
  identifier in the current client contract, so its bulk scan does not infer
  title matches from names alone.
- AniList exposes sequential episode progress rather than individual watched
  episode identities, so its library remains count-based while Trakt and Simkl
  use provider-confirmed episode states.
- Publish the Jellyfin bridge archive and repository manifest in a SeerrNG
  release, then verify the linked-user login against a live SeerrNG/Jellyfin pair.
  CI now smoke-tests plugin loading, settings persistence, auth requirements, and
  dashboard page registration against Jellyfin 10.11.11 on every push and PR.
- Verify same-window playback, browser fallback and session reset with a running
  Foreseer Desktop client and live Jellyfin server. Local protocol and ticket
  tests do not replace that desktop/runtime verification.
- Finish end-to-end UI and deployment verification before describing parity as
  complete. A provider client or an account link alone is not parity.
